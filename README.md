# 🤟 Sign Language Recognizer

## 🔍 Overview

The **Sign Language Recognizer** is a hardware-based system that translates sign language gestures into spoken or written text in real time. Unlike camera-based systems that rely heavily on visual clarity and angle, our solution uses a **sensor glove** embedded with **MPU6050 IMU sensors** to detect hand gestures more accurately, regardless of lighting or occlusion. This glove integrates **Kalman filters** for precise roll, pitch, and yaw measurements, allowing for more consistent and real-world deployable sign recognition.

## 🧤 Why Glove-Based Recognition?

Camera-based solutions often suffer from:
- Poor performance in low light or crowded backgrounds.
- Limited accuracy due to 2D depth perception and occlusion (e.g., hands crossing).
- High computational requirements for real-time 3D gesture tracking.

By contrast, our glove-based system:
- Captures **3D orientation and motion directly from the hand**, making it **lighting-independent**.
- Offers **fine-grained recognition of finger and hand gestures** using sensor fusion.
- Is **portable and wearable**, making it ideal for **outdoor use**, **on-the-go communication**, or in **low-light environments**.

## 🔬 How It Works

- The glove is embedded with **MPU6050 (Gyroscope + Accelerometer)** sensors on each finger.
- Sensor data (acceleration + angular velocity) is processed with a **Kalman Filter** for smooth and accurate estimation of **roll, pitch, and yaw**.
- The processed data is fed into a machine learning model that classifies the gestures.
- The final result is displayed as text or spoken through a text-to-speech module.

## 🧠 Kalman Filter Integration

MPU6050 sensors alone are noisy and prone to drift. To solve this, we implemented a **Kalman Filter**, which:
- Fuses gyroscope and accelerometer data.
- Filters out noise and sensor jitter.
- Produces smooth, real-time values for **gesture classification**.

This makes our system **highly stable**, especially when detecting subtle or fast sign language motions.
